# Train a 2-layer MLP neural network model to classify images from MNIST dataset.

Since the image is a 24 x 24 size grayscaled images, we can train it using MLP. In real word scenarios, the number of paramerts to be learned grows exponentially as image size increases, there by we use CNNs to train on images
